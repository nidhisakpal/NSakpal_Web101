                <p>Hey! Do you love to hike and camp? I'm Nidhi Sakpal and I plan and host local hiking + camping trips in the NJ/NY area. I'm passionate about conservation and connecting with nature. These trips are intended to build a community of like-minded people who appreciate the outdoors.</p>
